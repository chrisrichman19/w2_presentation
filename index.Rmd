# Background

- when (most recent launch of sentinel mission, 5th decemeber 2024) - launched from French Guinea
- who (Joint initiative of the european commision and european space agency)
- why (part of the Copernicus Sentinel 1 mission) 
- all weather, day and night imagery for land and ocean services (even through cloud cover)) - sentinel 1b launched in 2016 but has been unavailable due to power issues since august 2022. Copernicus Sentinel 1 mission designed as a two satellite mission - will synchronise with Sentinel-1A - orbiting 180° apart, so can image the entire Earth every six days.

## Background 2:

- what is its plan? 


(synchronise with Sentinel-1A - to reduce revisit time of SAR images from every 10 days to 5 days.) - not a research satellite - climate change and disaster response (flooding earthquake events) - long-term monitoring Earth’s land, oceans and ice
"Sentinel-1C introduces new capabilities for detecting and monitoring maritime traffic." Automatic Identification System?

The satellite is currently in its commissioning phase with **full operations** expecting to begin within the next few months.

One of the key features of Sentinel-1c is the Synthetic Aperture Radar instrument onboard.

# Applications: SHIP MONITORING

"Sentinel-1C will also carry a new Automatic Identification System (AIS), developed by the International Maritime Organisation to help ships avoid collisions at sea. The combination of radar images and AIS signals improves the monitoring of global shipping traffic and can also help detect piracy and other illegal activities."

overlaying ship data like location, course, and identity onto a satellite image, providing a comprehensive picture of maritime traffic

improvement on Sentinel 1A which does not carry AIS system. will allow for tracing and identifying of ships


OIL pollution monitoring

evidence of illegal oil discharge

"Oil slicks are distinctly visible in SAR imagery
Detections can be correlated with Automatic Identification System (AIS) (Sentinel-1C only) information broadcasts from ships to determine sources and prosecute offenders."

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width=60%, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/Oil_spill_spread.gif')
```

https://sentiwiki.copernicus.eu/web/s1-applications

"On 8 October 2018 at 05:28 GMT (07:28 CEST), the Copernicus Sentinel-1 mission captured its first images of the oil spill from a collision between two ships that had occurred the day before in the Mediterranean Sea, north of the French island of Corsica. This first image shows that the oil slick was about 20 km long. By the evening at 19:21 CEST, however, imagery shows that the slick had lengthened to about 35 km. And 24 hours later, on 9 October at 19:14 CEST, the slick had grown to about 60 km long."

- combined with AIS system to identify ships.

# Reflection

how sattelittes can operate in pairs to reduce revisit time - and how they can still operate alone - when sentinel 1b was out of action for 2years.

joint effort between many countries

replacement satellites - allow for new iterations of technologies to be introduced - especailly with 7 year lifecycle
