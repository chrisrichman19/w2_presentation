## Sentinel-1C: Background

.pull-left[
### Key Details
- **Launch Date**: 5th December 2024 launched
- **Who**: Joint initiative by the *European Commission* and *European Space Agency*
- **Orbit Altitude**: 693km
- **Mission Life**: 7 years

### Mission Design
- The Sentinel 1 mission was designed as a two satellite mission so the **Sentinel-1C** will synchronise with **Sentinel-1A** 180° apart.
- It will replace **Sentinel-1B** which has been out of service due to power issues since August 2022

### Sentinel 1 mission focus

-  Provide all weather, day and night imagery for land and ocean services:  
    - **Climate change monitoring**  
    - **Disaster response** (e.g., flooding, earthquake events)  
    - **Long-term Earth observation** of land, oceans, and ice


**Sentinel 1C** is currently in its commissioning phase with **full operations** expecting to begin within the next few months. 
- Once it is synchronised it will reduce revisit time of images from every **12 days** to every **6 days**.

## Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)


One of the key features of Sentinel 1 satellites is the Synthetic Aperture Radar instrument onboard.
.pull-left[
#### What is it?
- An active radar sensor that creates high-resolution images of Earth. 
- Capable of imaging through clouds and in total darkness, making it valuable for all-weather, day-and-night applications.
- Operates in four imaging modes with resolution ranging from 5m to 400 km.
]

.pull-right[
#### How does it work?

-  transmit microwave radar pulses to Earth's surface, which reflect and return to the receiver
- As the radar antenna moves along its flight path, it captures reflections from the same area at different angles.
- These multiple angles simulate a larger "synthetic aperture" for higher resolution.
- Signal processing algorithms then reconstruct these reflections into 2D images of the surface

# Applications: SHIP MONITORING

Sentintel-1C offers an improvement on Sentinel-1A's ship monitoring capabilities with the addition of Automatic Identification System (AIS):


- AIS is a system where ships report their identities and position.
  - Combines radar imagery with AIS signals, wil be able to provide detailed information about ship location, course, and identity.
  - Enabling a view of global shipping traffic and assist in detecting illegal piracy.

# Application: Oil pollution monitoring


- Oil slicks are distinctly in SAR images
- Detection can now be combined with AIS to help determine the offending ship/s.

In the gif on the right, Sentinel-1A captures an oil spill from a ship collision near Corsica, France.

Combined with AIS data, the Sentinel-1 mission can now help identify responsible ships and support environmental enforcement efforts.

### Working in pairs vs Solo

- I found it interesting to learn how satellites can work in pairs in order to reduce revisit time. 
- Despite the high costs of sattellites, I think this highlights the value and importance of frequent and available data of the Earth's surface. Monitoring would not be so useful if the revisit time is too long.  
- This also increases the resilience of the mission as the mission remained operational despite Sentinel-1B's two-year downtime.

.pull-right[
### Room for improvement with each launch

- These satellites have a 5–7 year lifecycle, creating opportunities to upgrade technology with each replacement.
- This does not seem long, and it means the ESA are constantly planning for new launches and contingency plans.
- but on the other hand it does allow each new satellite to learn from its predecessors and not be limited beacuse of aging technology.
